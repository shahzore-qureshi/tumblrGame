Tumblr Sidescrolling Game
========================

I worked on a video game at a hackathon at The College of New Jersey. This branch implements the latest Tumblr API to create a sidescrolling game with public tagged images. The game is based off of HTML5 and JavaScript. It also implements the game engine Crafty.js, which is open-source, and Firebase Forge, which allows multi-agent rendering in real time (aka multiplayer gaming!!).
