I worked on a video game at a hackathon at The College of New Jersey. The master branch implements the latest Tumblr API to create a sidescrolling game with public tagged images. The game is based off of HTML5 and JavaScript. It also implements the game engine Crafty.js, which is open-source, and Firebase Forge, which allows multi-agent rendering in real time (aka multiplayer gaming!!).
The second branch, called Quintus, implements the Quintus HTML5 JavaScript engine. I noticed that this engine is much smoother than the CraftyJS one, and it has native mobile device support. Try opening the game on a mobile screen and be amazed at how well it works!
