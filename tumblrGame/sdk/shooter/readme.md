# Shooter library

One of the most classic types of games is a space invader style game. This library provides a
set of classes to make implementation of such a game very easy.

If you want to get going as fast as possible then you can create a new project with `basil init <project name>`
and replace the contents of the `Application.js` of your new project with the contents of the `Application.js`
file in this repo.
